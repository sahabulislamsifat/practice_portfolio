          I am not the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything
          needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
          web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
          JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you
          100% web solution.

          They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
          developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it.
          And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
